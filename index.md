## BFFL Community Resources for COVID-19
As the world works together to overcome the unprecedented challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the team at the [Bauhaus Form + Function Lab](https://uni-weimar.de/bffl) is currently working with partners and collaborators across the region and across Europe to share relevant designs and optimizations for personal protective equipment and other materials, which can be produced with the standard tools found in prototype labs, makerspaces and individual studios in communities around the globe.

The Fine Print: Please be aware that designs below are the property of their respective creators. We strongly urge everyone to adhere to the strictest hygiene measures and to consult with local authorities before beginning production or distribution. While these designs are being shared in good faith, the BFFL and Bauhaus-Universit√§t Weimar do not guarantee the suitability for use, merchantability, or fitness for particular purpose of the designs listed below, and do not assume liability arising from their production or use.

### 3DVerkstan Visor
This [visor](https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/) is our current focus for local production. This design can be [optimized](https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/protective-visor-print-guide/) to print in under 40 minutes (Prusa Mk3, 0.4mm) or 25 minutes (Prusa Mk3, 0.8mm) and requires only 16g of filament per unit. We are currently producing these from PETG, although PLA or ABS can also be used if necessary. The front shield can be produced from a variety of materials, including consumer A4-size transparency films, and does not require the use of a laser cutter.

### Prusa RC1/2/3 Visor
This [visor](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc3) consists of two 3D-printed frame components and a lasercut PETG shield. While this robust design has a preliminary approval for medical use in the Czech Republic, it is more resource intensive to produce, requiring roughly three hours print time (Prusa Mk3, 0.4mm) and ~60 grams of PETG filament per unit. Production stacking has been demonstrated to work with this design.

### WHO Hand Sanitizer Formula
This [formula](https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf) can be produced using isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and glycerol. BFFL staff have been using this hand sanitizer for nearly four weeks.
